                    <h2>Facts About Dog</h2>
                    <p>Dogs are incredibly perceptive, with super-smellers, unique nose prints, and the ability to smell emotions like fear, while also being highly trainable and social companions, capable of learning many words and even detecting diseases like cancer, though they see colors differently and dream just like humans. They evolved from wolves, sweat through their paws, have three eyelids, and some breeds like Basenjis don't bark</p>

                    <p>Senses & Abilities
Super Sniffers: A dog's nose has up to 300 million scent receptors (vs. 5 million in humans), making their sense of smell 10,000 to 100,000 times better, helping them detect diseases and emotions by scent.
Smell Your Feelings: They can smell fear by detecting chemical changes in perspiration.</p>
